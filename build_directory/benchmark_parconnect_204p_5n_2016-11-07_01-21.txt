Summary: benchmark_parconnect is MPI-bound in this configuration
Compute:				          34.5% |==|
MPI:					          65.5% |======|
I/O:					           0.0% |
This application run was MPI-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is found in the MPI section below.


CPU:
A breakdown of the 34.5% total compute time:
Scalar numeric ops:			           2.2% |
Vector numeric ops:			           0.0% |
Memory accesses:			          97.3% |=========|
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.
No time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized.

Threads:
A breakdown of how multiple threads were used:
Computation:				          87.1% |========|
Synchronization:			          12.9% ||
Physical core utilization:		          98.9% |=========|
System load:				          95.9% |=========|
Thread usage appears to be well-optimized. Check the CPU breakdown for advice on further improving performance.


MPI:
A breakdown of the 65.5% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:		          98.0% |=========|
Time in point-to-point calls:		           2.0% |
Effective process collective rate:	       8.15e+07 bytes/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:	           50.8 bytes/s
Most of the time is spent in collective calls with a low transfer rate. This can be caused by inefficient message sizes, such as many small messages, or by imbalanced workloads causing processes to wait.


I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% I/O time:
Time in reads:				         100.0% |=========|
Time in writes:				           0.0% |
Effective process read rate:		       2.01e+07 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:		              0 bytes/s
Most of the time is spent in read operations with a low effective transfer rate. This may be caused by contention for the filesystem or inefficient access patterns. Use an I/O profiler to investigate which write calls are affected.


Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:		       4.57e+08 bytes
Peak process memory usage:		       9.37e+08 bytes
Peak node memory usage:			          68.0% |======|
There is significant variation between peak and mean memory usage. This may be a sign of workload imbalance or a memory leak.
The peak node memory usage is modest. Running with fewer MPI processes and more data on each process may be more efficient.

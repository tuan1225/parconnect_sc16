Summary: benchmark_parconnect is Compute-bound in this configuration
Compute:				          65.8% |======|
MPI:					          34.2% |==|
I/O:					           0.0% |
This application run was Compute-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is found in the CPU section below.


CPU:
A breakdown of the 65.8% total compute time:
Scalar numeric ops:			           1.7% |
Vector numeric ops:			           0.0% |
Memory accesses:			          97.4% |=========|
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.
No time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized.

Threads:
A breakdown of how multiple threads were used:
Computation:				           0.0% |
Synchronization:			           0.0% |
Physical core utilization:		          99.3% |=========|
System load:				          98.1% |=========|
No measurable time is spent in multithreaded code.


MPI:
A breakdown of the 34.2% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:		          98.1% |=========|
Time in point-to-point calls:		           1.9% |
Effective process collective rate:	       2.35e+08 bytes/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:	           78.4 bytes/s
Most of the time is spent in collective calls with an average transfer rate. Using larger messages and overlapping communication and computation may increase the effective transfer rate.


I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% I/O time:
Time in reads:				           0.0% |
Time in writes:				           0.0% |
Effective process read rate:		              0 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:		              0 bytes/s
No time is spent in I/O operations. There's nothing to optimize here!


Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:		       8.47e+08 bytes
Peak process memory usage:		       1.63e+09 bytes
Peak node memory usage:			          93.0% |========|
There is significant variation between peak and mean memory usage. This may be a sign of workload imbalance or a memory leak.

Notes:			

Summary: benchmark_parconnect is Compute-bound in this configuration
Compute:				         100.0% |=========|
MPI:					           0.0% |
I/O:					           0.0% |
This application run was Compute-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is found in the CPU section below.
As very little time is spent in MPI calls, this code may also benefit from running at larger scales.

CPU:
A breakdown of the 100.0% total compute time:
Scalar numeric ops:			           8.4% ||
Vector numeric ops:			           0.0% |
Memory accesses:			          90.8% |========|
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.
No time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized.

Threads:
A breakdown of how multiple threads were used:
Computation:				           0.0% |
Synchronization:			           0.0% |
Physical core utilization:		           2.3% |
System load:				           4.3% |
No measurable time is spent in multithreaded code.
Physical core utilization is low. Try increasing the number of processes to improve performance.

MPI:
A breakdown of the 0.0% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:		           0.0% |
Time in point-to-point calls:		           0.0% |
Effective process collective rate:	              0 bytes/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:	              0 bytes/s
No time is spent in MPI operations. There's nothing to optimize here!


I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% I/O time:
Time in reads:				           0.0% |
Time in writes:				           0.0% |
Effective process read rate:		              0 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:		              0 bytes/s
No time is spent in I/O operations. There's nothing to optimize here!


Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:		       3.03e+10 bytes
Peak process memory usage:		       3.89e+10 bytes
Peak node memory usage:			          60.0% |=====|
The peak node memory usage is modest. Larger problem sets can be run before scaling to multiple nodes.

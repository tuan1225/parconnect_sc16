Summary: benchmark_parconnect is MPI-bound in this configuration
Compute:				          31.3% |==|
MPI:					          68.7% |======|
I/O:					           0.0% |
This application run was MPI-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is found in the MPI section below.


CPU:
A breakdown of the 31.3% total compute time:
Scalar numeric ops:			           2.1% |
Vector numeric ops:			           0.0% |
Memory accesses:			          97.6% |=========|
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.
No time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized.

Threads:
A breakdown of how multiple threads were used:
Computation:				          88.1% |========|
Synchronization:			          11.9% ||
Physical core utilization:		          99.0% |=========|
System load:				          94.9% |========|
Thread usage appears to be well-optimized. Check the CPU breakdown for advice on further improving performance.


MPI:
A breakdown of the 68.7% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:		          98.8% |=========|
Time in point-to-point calls:		           1.2% |
Effective process collective rate:	       7.11e+07 bytes/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:	            109 bytes/s
Most of the time is spent in collective calls with a low transfer rate. This can be caused by inefficient message sizes, such as many small messages, or by imbalanced workloads causing processes to wait.


I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% I/O time:
Time in reads:				           0.0% |
Time in writes:				           0.0% |
Effective process read rate:		              0 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:		              0 bytes/s
Most of the time is spent in write operations with a very low effective transfer rate. This may be caused by contention for the filesystem or inefficient access patterns. Use an I/O profiler to investigate which write calls are affected.


Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:		       4.05e+08 bytes
Peak process memory usage:		       7.05e+08 bytes
Peak node memory usage:			          60.0% |=====|
There is significant variation between peak and mean memory usage. This may be a sign of workload imbalance or a memory leak.
The peak node memory usage is modest. Running with fewer MPI processes and more data on each process may be more efficient.

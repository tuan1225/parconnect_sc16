Summary: benchmark_parconnect is MPI-bound in this configuration
Compute:				          41.7% |===|
MPI:					          58.3% |=====|
I/O:					           0.0% |
This application run was MPI-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is found in the MPI section below.


CPU:
A breakdown of the 41.7% total compute time:
Scalar numeric ops:			           1.1% |
Vector numeric ops:			           0.0% |
Memory accesses:			          98.6% |=========|
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.
No time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized.

Threads:
A breakdown of how multiple threads were used:
Computation:				           0.0% |
Synchronization:			           0.0% |
Physical core utilization:		          99.8% |=========|
System load:				          91.5% |========|
No measurable time is spent in multithreaded code.


MPI:
A breakdown of the 58.3% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:		          98.9% |=========|
Time in point-to-point calls:		           1.1% |
Effective process collective rate:	       3.97e+07 bytes/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:	           12.3 bytes/s
Most of the time is spent in collective calls with a low transfer rate. This can be caused by inefficient message sizes, such as many small messages, or by imbalanced workloads causing processes to wait.


I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% I/O time:
Time in reads:				           0.0% |
Time in writes:				           0.0% |
Effective process read rate:		              0 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:		              0 bytes/s
No time is spent in I/O operations. There's nothing to optimize here!


Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:		       1.19e+09 bytes
Peak process memory usage:		       1.97e+09 bytes
Peak node memory usage:			          99.0% |=========|
There is significant variation between peak and mean memory usage. This may be a sign of workload imbalance or a memory leak.

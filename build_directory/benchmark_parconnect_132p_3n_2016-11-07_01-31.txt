Summary: benchmark_parconnect is MPI-bound in this configuration
Compute:				          45.6% |====|
MPI:					          54.4% |====|
I/O:					           0.0% |
This application run was MPI-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is found in the MPI section below.


CPU:
A breakdown of the 45.6% total compute time:
Scalar numeric ops:			           2.3% |
Vector numeric ops:			           0.0% |
Memory accesses:			          97.3% |=========|
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.
No time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized.

Threads:
A breakdown of how multiple threads were used:
Computation:				          83.3% |=======|
Synchronization:			          16.7% |=|
Physical core utilization:		         100.0% |=========|
System load:				          99.6% |=========|
Thread usage appears to be well-optimized. Check the CPU breakdown for advice on further improving performance.


MPI:
A breakdown of the 54.4% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:		          99.0% |=========|
Time in point-to-point calls:		           1.0% |
Effective process collective rate:	       1.26e+08 bytes/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:	           95.8 bytes/s
Most of the time is spent in collective calls with an average transfer rate. Using larger messages and overlapping communication and computation may increase the effective transfer rate.


I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% I/O time:
Time in reads:				         100.0% |=========|
Time in writes:				           0.0% |
Effective process read rate:		       4.51e+05 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:		              0 bytes/s
Most of the time is spent in read operations with a very low effective transfer rate. This may be caused by contention for the filesystem or inefficient access patterns. Use an I/O profiler to investigate which write calls are affected.


Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:		       6.45e+08 bytes
Peak process memory usage:		       1.08e+09 bytes
Peak node memory usage:			          84.0% |=======|
There is significant variation between peak and mean memory usage. This may be a sign of workload imbalance or a memory leak.

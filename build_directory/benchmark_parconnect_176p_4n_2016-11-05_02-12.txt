Summary: benchmark_parconnect is MPI-bound in this configuration
Compute:				          43.2% |===|
MPI:					          56.8% |=====|
I/O:					           0.0% |
This application run was MPI-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is found in the MPI section below.


CPU:
A breakdown of the 43.2% total compute time:
Scalar numeric ops:			           2.0% |
Vector numeric ops:			           0.0% |
Memory accesses:			          97.3% |=========|
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.
No time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized.

Threads:
A breakdown of how multiple threads were used:
Computation:				          63.2% |=====|
Synchronization:			          36.8% |===|
Physical core utilization:		          99.3% |=========|
System load:				          96.3% |=========|
Significant time is spent synchronizing threads. Check which locks cause the most overhead with a profiler.
This may be a sign of overly fine-grained parallelism or of workload imbalance between threads.

MPI:
A breakdown of the 56.8% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:		          98.8% |=========|
Time in point-to-point calls:		           1.2% |
Effective process collective rate:	       1.08e+08 bytes/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:	           97.9 bytes/s
Most of the time is spent in collective calls with an average transfer rate. Using larger messages and overlapping communication and computation may increase the effective transfer rate.


I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% I/O time:
Time in reads:				           0.0% |
Time in writes:				           0.0% |
Effective process read rate:		              0 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:		              0 bytes/s
Most of the time is spent in write operations with a very low effective transfer rate. This may be caused by contention for the filesystem or inefficient access patterns. Use an I/O profiler to investigate which write calls are affected.


Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:		       5.17e+08 bytes
Peak process memory usage:		       8.95e+08 bytes
Peak node memory usage:			          77.0% |=======|
There is significant variation between peak and mean memory usage. This may be a sign of workload imbalance or a memory leak.

/**
 * @class   bliss::concurrent::Runnable
 * @brief   not instantiable. An abstract concept of a runnable task.
 *          could be multithreaded, mpi based, or a single threaded task.
 * @details subclasses include runner and is subclasses, and user defined
 *          tasks.
 *
 *         	This interface allows Runners to be treated as tasks as well, so
 *         	nesting Runners is possible.
 *
 *          since we allow mix of different types of Runnables (tasks),
 *          we cannot use CRTP and static polymorphism, which requires
 *          all types to be known at compile time.
 *
 *          Use dynamic polymorphism and restrict task to be coarse grain
 *          (NOT inside inner loop).

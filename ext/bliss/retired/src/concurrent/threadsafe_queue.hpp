 * @details this header file contains the templated implementation of a thread-safe queue.  this class is used for MPI buffer management.
 *
 *    This class uses moodycamel's concurrent queue.
 *      can't use boost's lockfree queue:  boost expect T to have copy constructor, trivial assignment operator, and trivial destructor.

     * @class     bliss::concurrent::ThreadSafeQueue
     * @brief     a multi-producer, multi-consumer thread safe queue with an optional capacity
     * @details   This class is a wrapper for the moodycamel::concurrentqueue::ConcurrentQueue class.
     *            https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue
     *
     *          This class inherits the following properties:
     *            growable
     *            supports move semantics
     *            c++11 compatible
     *            threadsafe
     *            multiple producer, multiple consumer
     *
     *          The wrapper provides additional capabilities including:
     *            capacity limit
     *            disabling and enabling push operation (to "pause" the queue)
     *
     *          DUE TO LOCKS, this is NOT fast.  but may be fast enough for MPI buffer management.

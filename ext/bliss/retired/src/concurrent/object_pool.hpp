     * @brief ObjectPool class.  Allows reuse of previously allocated objects.  Also tracks objects that are currently in use.
     * @detail   supports various Locking strategies.  Acquire and release locking strategies do not need to be the same under some conditions.
     *          Supported LockTypes are MUTEX, SPINLOCK, THREADLOCAL, and NONE.
     *
     *          For MUTEX, SPINLOCK, and NONE, the Acquire and Release LockTypes must be the same.
     *
     *          For THREADLOCAL, Release LockType can be either THREADLOCAL or NONE.   In the first case, each thread tracks in-use objects in its own set.
     *            In the second case, the releasing thread is assume to be tracking the in-use objects so that an object is released only once.
     *
     *          There is currently no support for LOCKFREE ObjectPool because the requirement to track objects that are in use translates to needing a
     *            lockfree set, which we do not have at the moment.  one possibility is to punt the requirement to the calling threads.
     *
     *
     *          These requirements should be enforced by the template specializations.

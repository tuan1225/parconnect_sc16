     * @class     bliss::concurrent::ThreadSafeQueue
     * @brief     a multi-producer, multi-consumer thread safe queue with an optional capacity
     * @details   adapted from http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/threading/implementing-a-thread-safe-queue-using-condition-variables.html
     *            with SIGNIFICANT modifications
     *            1. use c++11 std::thread and atomic constructs
     *            2. incorporating move semantics.
     *            3. support a capacity limit.
     *            4. supports multiple producer, multiple consumer.
     *            5. allows blocking of the enqueue function, (useful when draining queue or when finishing the use of the queue).
     *
     *          note that this is NOT truly concurrent.  the class serializes parallel access.  move semantic minimizes the copy operations needed.
     *
     *          DUE TO LOCKS, this is NOT fast.  but may be fast enough for MPI buffer management.
